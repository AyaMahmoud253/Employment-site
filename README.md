Client-side validation and server-side checks for duplicate emails:
Client-side validation refers to validating user input on the client-side (in the web browser) before submitting the form to the server. It ensures that the data entered by the user meets certain requirements and is valid. Common validations include checking for required fields, email format validation, and numerical field validation. Server-side checks, on the other hand, are performed on the server to further validate the data and perform additional checks, such as checking if an email already exists in the database to prevent duplicate entries.
